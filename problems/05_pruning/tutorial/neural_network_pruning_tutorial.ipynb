    "### What is Neural Network Pruning?\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine you have a beautiful, fully grown tree 🌳. While every branch and leaf contributes to the tree's function, you might find that you can carefully trim certain branches without significantly affecting the tree's health or appearance. **Neural network pruning** works on the same principle!\n",
    "\n",
    "In deep learning, we often create networks that are **over-parameterized** - they have many more parameters than strictly necessary. Pruning allows us to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Reduce model size** 📉 (fewer parameters to store)\n",
    "- **Speed up inference** ⚡ (fewer computations)\n",
    "- **Prevent overfitting** 🎯 (simpler models generalize better)\n",
    "- **Improve interpretability** 🔍 (focus on important connections)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Concepts:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Sparsity**: The fraction of parameters that are zero (higher = more pruned)\n",
    "- **Structured vs Unstructured**: Removing entire neurons/channels vs individual weights\n",
    "- **Magnitude-based**: Removing weights with smallest absolute values\n",
    "- **Gradient-based**: Removing weights with least impact on loss\n",
    "\n",
    "### Mathematical Definition:\n",
    "\n",
    "Given a neural network with parameters $\\theta$, pruning creates a **sparse** version $\\theta_{sparse}$ where:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\theta_{sparse}[i] = \\begin{cases} \n",
    "\\theta[i] & \\text{if weight is important} \\\\\n",
    "0 & \\text{if weight is pruned}\n",
    "\\end{cases}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The **sparsity** is defined as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$s = \\frac{\\text{number of zero parameters}}{\\text{total number of parameters}}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Should We Care?\n",
    "\n",
    "🚀 **Mobile Deployment**: Smaller models fit on phones and edge devices  \n",
    "💰 **Cost Reduction**: Less computation = lower cloud costs  \n",
    "🌱 **Environmental Impact**: Fewer operations = less energy consumption  \n",
    "⚡ **Real-time Applications**: Faster inference for time-critical tasks  \n",
    "🎯 **Better Understanding**: Sparse models reveal which connections matter most\n"

    "## 2. 🧮 Mathematical Foundation\n",
    "\n",
    "Before diving into implementation, let's understand the mathematical framework behind pruning.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Core Trade-off\n",
    "\n",
    "Pruning is fundamentally about balancing two competing objectives:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Model Performance**: We want to maintain low prediction error\n",
    "2. **Model Sparsity**: We want to zero out as many weights as possible\n",
    "\n",
    "This creates a **multi-objective optimization problem**:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\min_{\\theta_{sparse}} \\left[ \\mathcal{L}(\\theta_{sparse}) + \\lambda \\cdot \\text{Complexity}(\\theta_{sparse}) \\right]$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where:\n",
    "- $\\mathcal{L}$ is our loss function (e.g., MSE for regression)\n",
    "- $\\lambda$ controls the sparsity-performance trade-off\n",
    "- $\\text{Complexity}$ measures how \"complex\" our model is\n",
    "\n",
    "### Our Specific Scoring Function\n",
    "\n",
    "In our pruning challenge, we use a sophisticated scoring function that captures this trade-off:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\text{score}(s, \\epsilon) = \\begin{cases}\n",
    "0 & \\text{if } \\epsilon > 1000 \\\\\n",
    "(1 - \\frac{\\epsilon}{1000})^{1.5} \\cdot s^{1.5} & \\text{otherwise}\n",
    "\\end{cases}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where:\n",
    "- $s$ = sparsity (fraction of zero weights)\n",
    "- $\\epsilon$ = MSE on test set\n",
    "\n",
    "### Understanding the Scoring Function\n",
    "\n",
    "This function is designed to:\n",
    "- **Reward high sparsity**: $s^{1.5}$ grows super-linearly with sparsity\n",
    "- **Penalize high error**: $(1 - \\frac{\\epsilon}{1000})^{1.5}$ decreases as MSE increases\n",
    "- **Set hard limits**: Score is 0 if MSE > 1000 (model completely broken)\n",
    "- **Balance both objectives**: Neither sparsity nor accuracy alone is sufficient\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Challenge\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a **discrete, non-convex optimization problem**. We need to decide for each weight: keep it or zero it out. With thousands of parameters, this creates an enormous search space!\n",
    "\n",
    "Traditional approaches:\n",
    "- **Magnitude pruning**: Remove smallest weights 📏\n",
    "- **Gradient-based**: Remove weights with small gradients 📈\n",
    "- **Structured pruning**: Remove entire neurons/filters 🏗️\n",
    "\n",
    "**Our Innovation**: Use intelligent approximation strategies to find near-optimal sparse representations! 🧠\n"

    "## 7. 🧠 Linear Approximation Strategy\n",
    "\n",
    "Now comes the exciting part! Instead of using simple heuristics like magnitude-based pruning, we'll use a sophisticated **linear approximation strategy**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Big Idea 💡\n",
    "\n",
    "What if we could find a way to make our complex 3-layer network (128 → 1024 → 10) behave like a simple linear model (128 → 10) while maintaining most of its expressive power?\n",
    "\n",
    "The key insight is:\n",
    "1. **Train a linear approximation** of the entire network (128 → 10 directly)\n",
    "2. **Use the hidden layer as a \"bridge\"** to transfer this linear knowledge\n",
    "3. **Create a sparse representation** that maintains the linear approximation's behavior\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why This Works\n",
    "\n",
    "For many regression tasks, the underlying function can be well-approximated by a linear model. Our hidden layer with 1024 neurons is **over-parameterized** - we don't need all that complexity!\n",
    "\n",
    "By training a linear model first, we learn the **essential linear relationships** in the data. Then we embed this knowledge into our larger network in a sparse way.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Mathematical Strategy\n",
    "\n",
    "Our approach creates a specific sparse pattern:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **First layer (128 → 1024)**: Identity-like mapping with small coefficients\n",
    "2. **Second layer (1024 → 10)**: Scaled version of the linear model's weights\n",
    "\n",
    "This creates a \\\"pathway\\\" through the network that implements the linear approximation while keeping most weights at zero.\n"
