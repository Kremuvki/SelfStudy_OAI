    "\n",
    "### What is Dependency Parsing?\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine you're reading a sentence and trying to understand **who does what to whom** 🤔. Dependency parsing is exactly that - it's the process of analyzing the grammatical structure of sentences to understand the relationships between words.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example**: \"Maria bought a beautiful red car yesterday.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "In this sentence:\n",
    "- **\"bought\"** is the main verb (root)\n",
    "- **\"Maria\"** is the subject of \"bought\"\n",
    "- **\"car\"** is the object of \"bought\"\n",
    "- **\"beautiful\"** and **\"red\"** modify \"car\"\n",
    "- **\"yesterday\"** modifies \"bought\"\n",
    "\n",
    "### Dependency Tree Structure\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "         bought\n",
    "    ______|______\n",
    "   |             |\n",
    " Maria          car\n",
    "             ____|____\n",
    "            |    |    |\n",
    "           a  beautiful red\n",
    "                      |\n",
    "                  yesterday\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Concepts:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Head**: The governing word in a relationship (e.g., \"bought\" governs \"Maria\")\n",
    "- **Dependent**: The word that depends on another (e.g., \"Maria\" depends on \"bought\")\n",
    "- **Root**: The main word of the sentence (usually the main verb)\n",
    "- **Tree Structure**: Each word has exactly one head (except root), forming a tree\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why is This Important?\n",
    "\n",
    "🤖 **Machine Translation**: Understanding structure helps translate correctly  \n",
    "🔍 **Question Answering**: Finding relationships between entities  \n",
    "📝 **Text Summarization**: Identifying key information structures  \n",
    "🧠 **Sentiment Analysis**: Understanding what modifies what  \n",
    "📊 **Information Extraction**: Finding structured data in text\n"

    "### The Dependency Parsing Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "Given a sentence $S = w_1, w_2, ..., w_n$ with $n$ words, we want to find:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Root word** $r \\in \\{1, 2, ..., n\\}$\n",
    "2. **Dependency edges** $E = \\{(h_i, d_i)\\}$ where $h_i$ is the head and $d_i$ is the dependent\n",
    "\n",
    "### Tree Constraints\n",
    "\n",
    "A valid dependency tree must satisfy:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Exactly one root**: $|\\{w_i : head(w_i) = \\text{NULL}\\}| = 1$\n",
    "2. **Connected**: Every word is reachable from root\n",
    "3. **Acyclic**: No cycles in the dependency graph\n",
    "4. **Single head**: Each non-root word has exactly one head\n",
    "\n",
    "### Distance Matrix\n",
    "\n",
    "For tree construction, we define the **distance matrix** $D$ where:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$D_{i,j} = \\text{shortest path length between words } w_i \\text{ and } w_j$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Key properties:\n",
    "- $D_{i,i} = 0$ (distance to self)\n",
    "- $D_{i,j} = D_{j,i}$ (symmetric)\n",
    "- $D_{i,j} = 1$ if there's a direct edge between $w_i$ and $w_j$\n",
    "\n",
    "### Depth from Root\n",
    "\n",
    "The **depth** of word $w_i$ is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$depth(w_i) = D_{root, i}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "- Root has depth 0\n",
    "- Direct children of root have depth 1\n",
    "- And so on...\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Neural Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of using traditional parsing algorithms, we'll use **neural networks** to:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Predict edge probabilities**: $P(edge_{i,j}) = f_{edge}(emb_i, emb_j)$\n",
    "2. **Predict root probabilities**: $P(root_i) = f_{root}(emb_i)$\n",
    "3. **Construct tree**: Use greedy algorithm with predicted probabilities\n"

    "\n",
    "Before diving into neural methods, let's understand how dependency parsing was traditionally done.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Classical Approaches\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. Transition-Based Parsing\n",
    "- **Idea**: Process words left-to-right, making parsing decisions\n",
    "- **Actions**: SHIFT (move to next word), REDUCE (create dependency)\n",
    "- **Problem**: Greedy decisions can lead to errors\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. Graph-Based Parsing\n",
    "- **Idea**: Score all possible edges, find best tree\n",
    "- **Algorithm**: Maximum Spanning Tree (MST)\n",
    "- **Problem**: Scoring function is hand-crafted\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. Rule-Based Parsing\n",
    "- **Idea**: Use grammatical rules to determine dependencies\n",
    "- **Example**: \"Adjectives modify nouns\"\n",
    "- **Problem**: Rules don't capture all linguistic phenomena\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Neural Approaches? 🤖\n",
    "\n",
    "❌ **Traditional Problems**:\n",
    "- Hand-crafted features\n",
    "- Limited context understanding\n",
    "- Difficulty handling ambiguity\n",
    "- Poor generalization\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ **Neural Advantages**:\n",
    "- **Automatic feature learning**: No manual feature engineering\n",
    "- **Rich representations**: Contextual embeddings from BERT\n",
    "- **Flexible architectures**: Can model complex relationships\n",

    "## 5. 🤖 BERT and Contextual Embeddings\n",
    "\n",
    "The key to our neural approach is using **HerBERT** (Polish BERT) to get rich, contextual representations of words.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why HerBERT?\n",
    "\n",
    "🧠 **Contextual Understanding**: Unlike traditional word embeddings, BERT considers the entire sentence context  \n",
    "🇵🇱 **Polish Language**: HerBERT is specifically trained on Polish text  \n",
    "🎯 **Syntactic Knowledge**: BERT's hidden layers capture syntactic relationships  \n",
    "🔄 **Subword Tokenization**: Handles unknown words gracefully\n",
    "\n",
    "### The BERT Architecture\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",

    "768-dimensional vectors\n",
    "   ↓ 12 Transformer Layers\n",
    "Contextual representations\n",
    "   ↓ Layer 7 (our choice)\n",
    "Rich syntactic features\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Layer 7?\n",
    "\n",
    "Research shows that **middle layers** of BERT capture the best syntactic information:\n",
    "- **Early layers** (1-3): Surface features, POS tags\n",
    "- **Middle layers** (4-8): Syntactic relationships, dependencies  \n",
    "- **Late layers** (9-12): Semantic features, task-specific info\n",

    "Now that we have our models, let's understand how to train them effectively for dependency parsing.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Data Challenge 📊\n",
    "\n",
    "**Imbalanced Data Problem**:\n",
    "- Most word pairs are **NOT** connected (negative examples)\n",
    "- Only a few word pairs **ARE** connected (positive examples)\n",
    "- Ratio can be 1:20 or worse!\n",
    "\n",
    "**Root Detection Problem**:\n",
    "- Only **ONE** word per sentence is the root\n",
    "- All other words are **NOT** roots\n",
    "- Even more imbalanced than edges!\n",
    "\n",
    "### Our Training Solutions 💡\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. Balanced Sampling for Distance Model\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Instead of using all negative examples:\n",
    "positive_pairs = pairs_with_edges      # Few examples\n",
    "negative_pairs = pairs_without_edges   # Many examples\n",
    "\n",
    "# Sample equal numbers:\n",
    "balanced_negatives = random.sample(negative_pairs, len(positive_pairs))\n",
    "training_data = positive_pairs + balanced_negatives\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. Balanced Sampling for Depth Model\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Instead of using all non-root words:\n",
    "root_words = [word for word in sentence if word.is_root]     # 1 example\n",
    "non_root_words = [word for word in sentence if not word.is_root]  # Many examples\n",
    "\n",

    "balanced_non_roots = random.sample(non_root_words, len(root_words))\n",
    "training_data = root_words + balanced_non_roots\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why This Works 🎯\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ **Prevents bias**: Model doesn't just predict \"no edge\" all the time  \n",
    "✅ **Faster training**: Smaller, balanced datasets train quicker  \n",
    "✅ **Better learning**: Model sees equal examples of both classes  \n",
    "✅ **Improved metrics**: Better precision and recall on positive class\n",
