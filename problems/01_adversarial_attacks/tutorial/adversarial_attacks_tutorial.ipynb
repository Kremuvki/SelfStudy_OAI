    "### What are Adversarial Attacks?\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine you have a perfect photo of a panda 🐼. A human can clearly see it's a panda. But what if we could add tiny, nearly invisible changes to the image that make a neural network think it's a gibbon? That's an **adversarial attack**!\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Concepts:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Original Image**: The clean, unmodified input\n",
    "- **Perturbation**: Small noise added to the image  \n",
    "- **Adversarial Example**: Original + Perturbation\n",
    "- **Attack Success**: When the model misclassifies the adversarial example\n",
    "\n",
    "### Mathematical Definition:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$x_{adv} = x + \\delta$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where:\n",
    "- $x$ is the original input\n",
    "- $\\delta$ is the perturbation (very small!)\n",
    "- $x_{adv}$ is the adversarial example\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Should We Care?\n",
    "\n",
    "🚗 **Autonomous vehicles**: Malicious signs could fool self-driving cars  \n",

    "Before diving into implementation, let's understand the math behind adversarial attacks.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Loss Function Perspective\n",
    "\n",
    "Neural networks learn by minimizing a loss function $L(\\theta, x, y)$ where:\n",
    "- $\\theta$ are the model parameters\n",
    "- $x$ is the input\n",
    "- $y$ is the true label\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Adversarial Objective\n",
    "\n",
    "For attacks, we want to **maximize** the loss by modifying the input:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\max_{\\delta} L(\\theta, x + \\delta, y) \\text{ subject to } ||\\delta||_\\infty \\leq \\epsilon$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This means: \"Find the smallest perturbation $\\delta$ that maximizes the model's confusion\"\n",

    "The key insight: **gradients tell us how to change inputs to increase loss!**\n",

    "**Why does this work?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Neural networks are trained to be smooth and continuous. Small changes in input should lead to small changes in output. But this smoothness is also their weakness - we can exploit the gradient information to find directions that maximally confuse the model!\n",
