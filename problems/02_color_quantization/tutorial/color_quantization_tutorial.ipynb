    "\n",
    "### What is Color Quantization?\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine you have a beautiful photograph with millions of colors 🌈. Color quantization is the process of reducing this rich palette to a much smaller set of colors while preserving the visual quality as much as possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "Think of it like this:\n",
    "- **Original image**: 16.7 million possible colors (24-bit RGB)\n",
    "- **Quantized image**: Only 37 carefully chosen colors\n",
    "- **Goal**: Make the 37-color version look as close to the original as possible\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Concepts:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Color Palette**: The limited set of colors we can use (37 in our case)\n",
    "- **Color Assignment**: Mapping each original pixel to the closest palette color\n",
    "- **Quality Metrics**: How we measure how \"good\" our quantization is\n",
    "- **Color Space**: The mathematical representation of colors (RGB)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Mathematical Definition:\n",
    "\n",
    "Given an image $I$ with pixels $p_{i,j} \\in \\mathbb{R}^3$ and a palette $P = \\{c_1, c_2, ..., c_k\\}$ where $k=37$:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$Q(I) = \\{q_{i,j} | q_{i,j} = \\arg\\min_{c \\in P} ||p_{i,j} - c||_2\\}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where $Q(I)$ is our quantized image and $||\\cdot||_2$ is the Euclidean distance.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Should We Care?\n",
    "\n",
    "🖼️ **Image Compression**: Reduce file sizes while maintaining quality  \n",
    "🎮 **Game Graphics**: Limited color palettes for retro aesthetics  \n",
    "🖨️ **Printing**: Optimize colors for specific printing processes  \n",
    "📱 **Mobile Displays**: Adapt images for devices with limited color ranges  \n",
    "🎨 **Artistic Effects**: Create stylized, poster-like images\n"

    "## 2. 🧮 Mathematical Foundation\n",
    "\n",
    "Before diving into implementation, let's understand the math behind color quantization.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Optimization Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "Color quantization is fundamentally an optimization problem. We want to find the best palette $P$ and assignment function $f$ such that:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\min_{P,f} \\sum_{i,j} ||p_{i,j} - f(p_{i,j}, P)||_2^2$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the **Mean Squared Error (MSE)** - our primary quality metric.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Color Cost Function\n",
    "\n",
    "In our specific problem, we have an additional constraint - the **color cost**. Some colors are \"more expensive\" than others:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\text{Color Cost}(c) = \\min_{v \\in V} ||c - v||_2$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where $V$ are the vertices of the RGB cube: $\\{(0,0,0), (0,0,255), (0,255,0), ..., (255,255,255)\\}$\n",
    "\n",
    "### Complete Objective Function\n",
    "\n",
    "Our final objective combines both image quality and color preference:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$L = 2 \\cdot MSE + 21 \\cdot \\max(\\text{color costs}) + 42 \\cdot \\text{mean}(\\text{color costs})$$\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Challenge\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a **non-convex, combinatorial optimization problem**. Traditional approaches:\n",
    "- K-means clustering 📊\n",
    "- Median cut algorithm ✂️\n",
    "- Octree quantization 🌳\n",
    "\n",

    "### 💡 Key Insight\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why is this problem so hard?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Traditional clustering algorithms like K-means optimize for minimal within-cluster variance, but our objective function is much more complex! We need to balance:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Image Quality**: How similar the quantized image looks to the original\n",
    "2. **Color Preferences**: Some colors are \"cheaper\" than others (RGB cube vertices)\n",
    "3. **Exact Count**: We must use exactly 37 colors, no more, no less\n",
    "\n",
    "Think of it like choosing a color palette for a painting - you want colors that represent your image well, but you also prefer certain \"primary\" colors that are easier to work with!\n"
